### 1. Enter the Adventure Arena

To get started, enter the "adventure arena" by clicking the button below. This will create a GitHub Codespace that you can work in. Once it loads select the **Create codespace** button.

[![Enter Adventure Arena](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=Enter+Adventure+Arena&message=Open&color=brightgreen&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/microsoft/CopilotAdventures)

**NOTE:** You can use 60 hours of GitHub Codespaces [for free](https://github.com/features/codespaces#pricing) each month.

If you'd prefer, you can clone the repo and run locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/copilotadventures
```

### 2. Choose an Adventure

**Pre-Reqs:** Basic programming language knowledge and experience with VS Code is helpful.

#### New to GitHub Copilot?

If you're new to GitHub Copilot and want to learn how to get started using it, start with one of these warmup adventures:

- **[Warmup Adventure - Agent Mode](./Adventures/Agent/Warmup-Adventure-Agent.md)** - Learn GitHub Copilot's autonomous Agent Mode
- **[Warmup Adventure - Ask Mode](./Adventures/Ask/Warmup-Adventure-Ask.md)** - Learn GitHub Copilot's Ask Mode

#### Understanding GitHub Copilot Modes

GitHub Copilot offers three powerful interaction modes:

ü§ñ **Agent Mode** - Autonomous AI that can understand complex tasks, create entire projects from scratch, and work across multiple files. Perfect for building complete applications with minimal guidance. Agent mode can iterate on its own code, automatically identify and fix errors, and execute terminal commands.

‚úèÔ∏è **Edit Mode** - Multi-file editing experience that combines conversational flow with inline code suggestions. Copilot Edits can propose changes across multiple files, create new files, and provide fast iterative feedback for large-scale modifications.

üí¨ **Ask Mode** - Interactive chat mode where you collaborate step-by-step with Copilot through conversation. Great for learning, getting explanations, brainstorming solutions, and when you want more control over the process.

## ü§ñ Agent Mode Adventures

*Experience autonomous AI agent development with comprehensive project creation*

#### Beginner Adventures

- **[The Clockwork Town of Tempora](./Adventures/Agent/1-Beginner/The-Clockwork-Town-of-Tempora-Agent.md)** - In the mechanical town of Tempora, everything operates on clockwork and precise timing. At the heart of the town is the Grand Clock Tower, responsible for keeping time for all the town's activities. However, over the years, some smaller clocks in the town have started to drift away from the accurate time.
- **[The Magical Forest of Algora](./Adventures/Agent/1-Beginner/The-Magical-Forest-of-Algora-Agent.md)** - Deep within the enchanted Forest of Algora, two mystical creatures, the Lox and the Faelis, perform a sacred dance every millennium. This dance is not just for celebration but is a ritual to bring balance to the forest.
- **[The Command Center of Stellaris (Custom Agent Chat Mode)](./Adventures/Agent/1-Beginner/The-Command-Center-of-Stellaris-Agent.md)** - In the galaxy of Stellaris, the Galactic Command Center coordinates missions across star systems using expert AI commanders. A recent upgrade enables custom command protocols, letting commanders activate mission-specific modes with advanced tools and guidance for any challenge.

#### Intermediate Adventures

- **[The Celestial Alignment of Lumoria](./Adventures/Agent/2-Intermediate/The-Celestial-Alignment-of-Lumoria-Agent.md)** - In the vast expanse of the Galaxia Nebulae, a rare phenomenon is about to occur in the Lumoria star system. The planets, revolving around the Lumorian Sun, are aligning in a celestial dance that happens only once every few millennia. This alignment has a unique effect on how the light from the Lumorian Sun reaches each planet.
- **[The Legendary Duel of Stonevale](./Adventures/Agent/2-Intermediate/The-Legendary-Duel-of-Stonevale-Agent.md)** - In the mystical realm of Stonevale, two warriors, Rok and Papyra, are chosen for a duel that determines the fate of their tribes for the next century. The arena, known as Scissoria, is where each move carries weight and consequences.
- **[The Scrolls of Eldoria](./Adventures/Agent/2-Intermediate/The-Scrolls-of-Eldoria-Agent.md)** - In the enchanted land of Eldoria, ancient scrolls contain the secrets of the universe. These scrolls, however, were scattered and protected by the Elders using powerful spells. These spells concealed the secrets within the scrolls, adding layers of misleading information to deter prying eyes. Over time, these scrolls were digitized and stored in the Great Eldorian Library, accessible only through the Eldorian Web of Knowledge.

#### Advanced Adventures

- **[The Gridlock Arena of Mythos](./Adventures/Agent/3-Advanced/The-Gridlock-Arena-of-Mythos-Agent.md)** - In the mystical land of Mythos, creatures from various realms come together to battle in the Gridlock Arena, a chess-like grid where strategy, power, and cunning are tested. Each creature has its unique move, power, and strategy.
- **[The Knowledge Cartographer (Agent + MCP)](./Adventures/Agent/3-Advanced/The-Knowledge-Cartographer-Agent-MCP.md)** - In the vast digital expanse of the Akashic Archives, ancient knowledge fragments are scattered across countless web domains. As a Knowledge Cartographer, you'll build a system that combines web scraping with intelligent knowledge organization using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode and MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools.

### 3. Start Coding

Read Your Copilot Adventure description, the high-Level tasks to perform, and the GitHub Copilot hints to help you write your code.

- Use [GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/get-started/quickstart) to help you write the code for the adventure. You can use any language you'd like. Try learning a new language if you're up for the challenge (more on that below)!
- Leave any comments in your code to explain your thought process and show prompts that GitHub Copilot used to help you out.

### 4. Submit Your Adventure Solution (Optional)

If you'd like to share your solution with others, perform the following steps:

- Publish your adventure solution to a GitHub repo. 
- Visit https://github.com/microsoft/CopilotAdventures/issues and select `New Issue`.
- Use the following naming convention for the issue title. 

    ```
    Solution for [Name of Your Adventure]
    ```

    Replace `[Name of Your Adventure]` with the adventure name you chose to solve (example: `The Legendary Duel of Stonevale`).

- Add a link to your GitHub repo in the body section.
- If you have any feedback, share what you found (good or bad). We'd love to hear your feedback!

## Next Steps: Learn a New Language or Create a UI for Your Adventure

</a>

Once you've completed your first adventure, try it again but this time use GitHub Copilot to complete the adventure using a language that's new to you. For example, if you normally write code in C#, use Copilot to help you solve the adventure using Python or another language you'd like to learn more about.

Try creating a UI for your adventure. Use pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript or a library/framework of your choosing. Let GitHub Copilot help you out with the UI code. If your UI requires images, consider using [Bing Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/create) or another AI image generation service.

## Have a Copilot Adventure Idea? Submit a PR!

Do you have a copilot adventure story/puzzle you'd like to submit for others to go through? We'd love to see it! Please submit a pull request to this repository with your adventure and solution. 

- Use `New Copilot Adventure: [Your Adventure Name]` for the PR title. Replace `[Your Adventure Name]` with the name of your adventure.
- Include if your adventure is at the beginner, intermediate, or advanced level.
- Follow the markdown template used with each adventure in the [Adventures](./Adventures) folder as you create your adventure.
- Provide an image for your adventure (use [Microsoft Copilot Image Creator](https://www.bing.com/images/create) or another image generator solution). The image should "landscape" and be 1456x832 pixels.
- Provide a solution using your chosen language. Place all of the code in a single file (to keep things simple), add it to the appropriate language folder in `Solutions`, and include it in the PR.

We'll review your submission and merge it into the repo if it meets the criteria.
